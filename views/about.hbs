                    <h2>Kyuyoung Shim - "the developer"</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
                    <p>My Name is Kyuyoung Shim and I'm currently studing Computer Programming at Seneca College of Applied
                        Arts and Technology. My Interests are everything related to HTML, JavaScript and CSS and I'm currently
                        in the process of mastering the MEAN stack. It's my goal to become a full-stack JavaScript developer
                        and continue to learn and expand my experience to include all the amazing new dev tools, environments,
                        libraries, workflows and design methodologies available to the full-stack / MEAN developer community.
                    </p>
                    <p>Enjoy browsing my app! - If you have any questions, or are in need of a JS dev for your project, I can
                        be found at <a href="mailto:kshim3@myseneca.ca" target="_top">kshim3@myseneca.ca</a>.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
